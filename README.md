# CAPM for calculating the Expected Return of a Stock

## What is CAPM?
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of investing in a security. It shows that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk-free return plus a risk premium, which is based on the beta of that security. Below is an illustration of the CAPM concept.

### ER_i = R_f + β_i(ER_m − R_f)
Where,

ER_i = expected return of investment

R_f = risk-free rate

β_i = beta of the investment

ER_m = expected return of market

(ER_m - R_f) = market risk premium
